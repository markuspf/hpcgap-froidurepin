The HPC-GAP package `froidurepin'
=================================


This is an experimental package that implements sequential and
parallelised variants of Froidure's and Pin'd algorithm for semigroup
enumeration.

The sequential code should in principle run on GAP 4, but this is not a
priority since the GAP package [semigroups](https://bitbucket.org/james-d-mitchell/semigroups)
has a very good sequential implementation of this algorithm.
